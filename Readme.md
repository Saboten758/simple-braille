# Simple Braille Application<br/>
This is a simple application, I made for our project on Quality Education for **GDSC**. It is a flask application that relies front.html, which is styled using bootstrap. It will take a pdf as an input, convert it into braille and save it as pdf or download it as mp3 audio.<br>To start the application, simply type python server.py<br />This needs a windows machine to work, as the text to speech uses win32com.client for Co-Initializing. All the requirements are written in requirements.txt
